1. Classes and Objects
A class in C# is a blueprint for creating objects (instances of classes). It defines properties (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that the object will have.
Object: An instance of a class. It is created based on the structure defined in the class, with its own unique data.

2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (fields) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also restricts access to certain details of an object, such as making fields private and exposing them through public methods (getters/setters).


3. Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (parent class), allowing code reuse and logical hierarchy.

4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while still maintaining their own behavior. In C#, polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

Method Overriding (Run-time Polymorphism):
This happens when a child class provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in the parent class using the virtual and override keywords.

Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism):
Method overloading allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but different parameters.

5. Abstraction
Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. In C#, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

6. Interfaces
Interfaces define a contract for classes, specifying what methods a class should implement, without providing the implementation. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for more flexible design.

Why Use OOP in C#?
Modularity: Classes and objects help break the program into smaller, manageable pieces.
Code Reusability: Through inheritance, methods and fields from one class can be reused in other classes.
Scalability: OOP allows for easy expansion and modification of programs.
Maintainability: Encapsulation makes it easier to update and maintain code without affecting other parts of the program.
