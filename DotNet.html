        <b>Why Async/Await Isn't the Same as Synchronous Code</b>
        <br>
        While async and await may appear to behave like synchronous programming due to the linear, 
        readable flow, they are fundamentally different in how they handle tasks and system resources. 
        Let's delve into why this is the case and how async/await is distinct from synchronous programming

        <br>
        <br>
        async/await has a similar flow to synchronous code, itâ€™s fundamentally different due to its non-blocking nature 
        and efficient thread management, especially valuable in keeping applications responsive
